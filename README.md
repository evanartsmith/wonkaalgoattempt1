DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A GOOD STRATEGY

This was one of my first iterations that actually showed some signs of success that I have since iterated on to the point where I have them 
using real money to trade using Binance and 3Commas for API handeling from Tradingview Webhook URL's. It got me into algorithmic trading
but also taught me a lot of lessons about backtesting and the creative process when it comes to algorithmic trading. Here is a picture
of results.

This is trading on the 5 minute chart which backtests a month back so 7.57% in a month is not too shabby but my current bots work a ton better
